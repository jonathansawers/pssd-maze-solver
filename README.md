# pssd-maze-solver
Mase solver program designed for COMPSCI 2203
Group name: The Maze Runners

## Install Instructions
Run `make` and then run `./maze`

## Brief Description
This project will implement a program that can both generate and solve mazes. The generator will create random mazes using algorithms such as recursive backtracking or randomized Primâ€™s algorithm, ensuring that each maze is unique and solvable. Users will also be able to upload maze designs. The solver will then apply search algorithms to find and visualize the shortest or alternative paths through the maze. The program will run in a Linux environment with a simple text-based or graphical output, and will be documented so that users can easily build, run, and experiment with different algorithms.
